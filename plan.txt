CORAL

An online form where people can post school related questions and people will answer them. 
- Anyone with an account can make a post 
- Anyone with an account can answer
- Only moderator accounts can approve
- Sub page for different subjects
- Video and image responses are a really good thing
- People can still submit answers when there already is an approved answer to give a better approved answer

Once that is finished we
- Add a point system. 
    - the way people get points is when there answer is marked helpful
    - Only the single approved answer can be marked helpful leading to competition for better answers 
- Connect students with tutors (schedule (possibily also earn points))
